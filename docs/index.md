# Introduction

Data and its use is becoming more and more important. In today's digital race applications that create, transport or use data are becoming key components that are heavily invested in. 
At the same time the number of products and the innovation that comes with them is growing heavily. 

Preparation for future is needed. As architectures and platforms become more diverse, independent and connected they are growing steadily potentially creating huge risks for scaling and upgrading. 
To oversee cost and complexity we believe that investment in metadata foundations is crucial.

Metadata – otherwise data describing the definition, context, classification, etc. of data itself – is the key to allow applications to talk to each other. 
It is no longer just a by-product, it is the language of automation. Applications become more intelligent by integrating, interpretating and augmenting this metadata. 

# Frameworks

We are passionate about automation. Our goal is to promote and create metadata driven frameworks that impact delivery and operation processes.
